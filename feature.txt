Dear Students
Hope you all are staying safe and so your family members too.

Take necessary measures and precautions to keep yourself and your family members to be safe and don't venture out with out any reason. 



At the outset CDC would like to give you following update with respect to submission of your Project Report.



All PAT internship students make sure that your project is approved in VTOP as PAT intern. IF not send a gentle reminder to placement1@vit.ac.in. 
All of you can follow VIT Capstone project and need to have only soft copy of their project completion certificate along with this project report.
All the students can submit their project once it get completed and upload the required report and project completion certificate along with the same in VTOP. 
For some students we have given extension  but let them submit a report in VTOP on or before 01.08.2021.
Make sure all your mentors to submit their scores well ahead of 30.06.2021.  


Thanking you

Best Regards
